            Please review only the code changes in this pull request and provide feedback.

            IMPORTANT: Check the current CI status first. If all CI checks are passing (SUCCESS), ignore any historical comments about code quality failures. Only address current, real issues.

            Focus on:
            - Code quality and TypeScript/Node.js best practices
            - Security vulnerabilities and potential issues
            - Performance considerations
            - Adherence to the project's coding standards in CLAUDE.md
            - MCP server best practices
            - Type safety and proper TypeScript type annotations
            - Async/await patterns and error handling

            Consider the project context:
            - This is a TypeScript Node.js MCP server using @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
            - Implements hierarchical project management (Projects → Epics → Features → Tasks)
            - Uses Zod for data validation and YAML/Markdown for file storage
            - Follows strict typing with TypeScript
            - Uses ESLint for linting, Prettier for formatting, and Jest for testing

            Avoid reviewing files in: node_modules/, dist/, coverage/, .npm/, temp/, bin/, .trellis/
