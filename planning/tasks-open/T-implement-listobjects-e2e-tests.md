Implement comprehensive E2E tests for the list_objects MCP tool.

## Test Location

Create tests in: `src/__tests__/e2e/crud/listObjects.e2e.test.ts`

## Test Requirements

- Test filtering by object type (project, epic, feature, task)
- Test filtering by status (open, closed, with includeClosed flag)
- Test filtering by priority (high, medium, low)
- Test scope-based filtering (by parent object)
- Test combined filters (multiple criteria simultaneously)
- Verify returned object structure and completeness

## Key Test Cases

1. List only projects, tasks, features (type filtering)
2. Filter by status (open, closed, includeClosed behavior)
3. Filter by priority levels
4. Scope filtering - list objects under specific parent
5. Combined filters - multiple criteria at once
6. Verify object structure in responses
7. Test empty result scenarios
8. Test large result sets

Ensure proper JSON parsing of list responses and verify all filter combinations work correctly.
