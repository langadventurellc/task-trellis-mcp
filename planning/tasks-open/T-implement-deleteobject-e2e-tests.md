Implement comprehensive E2E tests for the delete_object MCP tool.

## Test Location

Create tests in: `src/__tests__/e2e/crud/deleteObject.e2e.test.ts`

## Test Requirements

- Test successful deletion of standalone objects
- Test cascading deletion behavior with force flag
- Test deletion prevention for objects with dependencies
- Test file system cleanup after deletion
- Test error scenarios: non-existent objects, objects with children
- Verify proper handling of parent-child relationships

## Key Test Cases

1. Delete standalone project and verify file removal
2. Delete standalone task and verify file removal
3. Test deletion with children (should fail without force)
4. Test force deletion with cascading behavior
5. Test deletion prevention for objects with dependencies
6. Delete dependent object first, then prerequisite
7. Error handling for non-existent objects
8. Verify complete file system cleanup

Test both hierarchical and dependency relationships to ensure proper validation.
