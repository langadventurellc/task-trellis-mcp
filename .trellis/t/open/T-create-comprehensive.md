# Create Comprehensive LocalTaskTrellisService Unit Tests

## Context

As tools are refactored to use TaskTrellisService, the business logic testing needs to move from tool tests to service tests. The existing tool tests contain detailed business logic validation that should now test the service methods directly.

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Create service test file** (`src/services/local/__tests__/LocalTaskTrellisService.test.ts`):
   - Test all LocalTaskTrellisService methods with comprehensive coverage
   - Move existing business logic tests from tool tests to service tests
   - Mock Repository for service tests
   - Test error handling, validation, and edge cases

2. **Extract test cases from existing tool tests**:
   - Review all existing tool tests in `src/tools/__tests__/`
   - Identify business logic test cases that should move to service tests
   - Adapt test cases to test service methods directly instead of tool handlers
   - Preserve all validation, error handling, and business rule tests

3. **Service methods to test**:
   - `createObject` - object creation, validation, hierarchy rules
   - `updateObject` - updates, status changes, validation
   - `listObjects` - filtering, sorting, status handling
   - `claimTask` - task claiming logic, prerequisites
   - `completeTask` - task completion, file tracking
   - `appendObjectLog` - log entry addition
   - `pruneClosed` - closed object pruning logic
   - `replaceObjectBodyRegex` - regex replacement logic

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all LocalTaskTrellisService methods
- [ ] All business logic test cases moved from tool tests
- [ ] Repository properly mocked in service tests
- [ ] Error handling and validation thoroughly tested
- [ ] Edge cases and boundary conditions covered
- [ ] Test file follows existing test patterns and structure
- [ ] All tests pass with good coverage metrics

## Testing Requirements

Ensure service tests cover:

- Successful operations for each method
- Error conditions and proper error handling
- Validation logic for all input parameters
- Business rules and constraints
- Repository interaction patterns
