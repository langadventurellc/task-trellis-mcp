## Context

After implementing hierarchical prerequisite checking, we need comprehensive integration tests to verify the feature works correctly across the entire system, including complex multi-level hierarchies and edge cases.

## Implementation Requirements

Create integration tests that verify:

1. **Multi-level hierarchy scenarios** (Project → Epic → Feature → Task)
2. **Mixed prerequisite states** at different hierarchy levels
3. **Performance with realistic data volumes**
4. **Edge cases and error conditions**

## Test Scenarios to Implement

### 1. Basic Hierarchical Blocking

```typescript
// Test: Task blocked by parent feature's prerequisites
- Create Feature A with prerequisite on Feature B (open)
- Create Task under Feature A
- Verify Task cannot be claimed
- Complete Feature B
- Verify Task can now be claimed
```

### 2. Multi-Level Hierarchy

```typescript
// Test: Task blocked by grandparent epic's prerequisites
- Create Epic A with prerequisite on Epic B (open)
- Create Feature under Epic A
- Create Task under Feature
- Verify Task cannot be claimed
- Complete Epic B
- Verify Task can now be claimed
```

### 3. Mixed Prerequisites

```typescript
// Test: Multiple tasks with different blocking levels
- Create hierarchy with mixed prerequisite states
- Verify correct tasks are filterable/claimable
- Test with 10+ tasks to ensure performance
```

### 4. Complex Dependency Chains

```typescript
// Test: Chain of dependencies across hierarchy
- Epic A → depends on → Epic B
- Epic B → depends on → Epic C
- Feature under Epic A with own prerequisites
- Tasks under Feature
- Verify proper blocking/unblocking cascade
```

### 5. Edge Cases

```typescript
// Test: Orphaned tasks (parent deleted)
- Create task with parent
- Delete parent
- Verify task prerequisite checking handles missing parent

// Test: Circular prevention
- Attempt to create circular parent references
- Verify system prevents/handles appropriately
```

## Implementation Approach

1. Create new test file: `/src/services/local/__tests__/claimTask.hierarchical.test.ts`
2. Use test utilities to create complex object hierarchies
3. Test both individual operations and batch operations
4. Include performance benchmarks for large hierarchies

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All hierarchical blocking scenarios work correctly
- [ ] Performance tests pass (< 200ms for 50 object hierarchy)
- [ ] Edge cases are handled gracefully
- [ ] Tests are maintainable and well-documented
- [ ] Coverage includes both positive and negative test cases
- [ ] Tests verify error messages are appropriate

## Testing Requirements

The tests themselves should:

- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Include setup/teardown for clean test isolation
- Mock repository appropriately
- Include performance assertions where relevant
- Document complex scenarios with comments

## Files to Create/Modify

- Create: `/src/services/local/__tests__/claimTask.hierarchical.test.ts`
- Potentially modify test utilities for hierarchy creation helpers

## Performance Considerations

- Tests should verify that checking a 4-level hierarchy completes in < 100ms
- Batch operations (filtering 20+ tasks) should complete in < 500ms
