# Final Integration Testing and Quality Validation

## Context

After all tools have been refactored to use TaskTrellisService and comprehensive tests have been created, we need to ensure the entire system works correctly and meets quality standards.

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Run all quality checks** (as required by CLAUDE.md):
   - Execute `npm run quality` to run linting, formatting, and type checks
   - Execute `npm test` to run all unit tests
   - Fix any issues found during quality checks

2. **Integration testing**:
   - Test each refactored tool through the MCP server interface
   - Verify all tool operations work end-to-end with service injection
   - Ensure backward compatibility - existing functionality preserved
   - Test tool interaction patterns and complex workflows

3. **Validation checklist**:
   - All TypeScript compilation passes without errors
   - All unit tests pass (both tool and service tests)
   - Linting passes without issues
   - Code formatting is consistent
   - No regression in functionality
   - Service dependency injection works correctly

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `npm run quality` passes without errors
- [ ] `npm test` passes with all tests green
- [ ] All refactored tools work correctly through MCP interface
- [ ] No functional regressions detected
- [ ] Service injection pattern works consistently
- [ ] Code quality standards maintained
- [ ] Documentation updated if necessary

## Testing Requirements

- Manual testing of complex tool workflows
- Verification that all existing functionality is preserved
- Performance testing to ensure no degradation
- Error handling validation across all tools
