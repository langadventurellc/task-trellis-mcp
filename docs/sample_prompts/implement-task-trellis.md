# Implement Task Command

Claim and implement the next available task from the backlog using the Trellis task management system with the Research and Plan ‚Üí Implement workflow.

Use ULTRATHINK.

## MCP Server Setup

Ensure the Task Trellis MCP server is properly configured. The server can be activated with:

- `activate` tool with `mode: "local"` and `projectRoot: "/path/to/project"` (if not configured via command line)
- Or started with command line arguments: `--mode local --projectRootFolder /path/to/project`

This creates a `.trellis` folder inside the project root for task storage.

### Trellis System Overview

The Trellis task management system organizes work in a hierarchical structure:

- **Projects**: Large-scale initiatives or products (e.g., "E-commerce Platform Redesign")
- **Epics**: Major work streams within a project (e.g., "User Authentication", "Payment Processing")
- **Features**: Specific functionality within epics (e.g., "Login Form", "Password Reset")
- **Tasks**: Atomic units of work, 1-2 hours each (e.g., "Create user model", "Add email validation")

This hierarchy enables parallel development, clear dependencies, and manageable work units.

## Goal

Automatically claim the highest-priority available task and implement it following project standards, with comprehensive research, planning, and quality checks before marking complete.

## Process

### 1. Claim Next Available Task

Command: `claim_task`

#### Input

`$ARGUMENTS` (optional) - Can specify:

- Specific task ID to claim (e.g., "T-create-user-model")
- `--worktree (worktree-path)` - Worktree identifier to stamp on claimed task (currently informational only)
- `--scope (object-id)` - Hierarchical scope for task filtering (P-, E-, F- prefixed)
- `--force` - Bypass validation when claiming specific task (only with `taskId`)
- Additional context or preferences

#### Instructions

Claims are made against the current working directory's task trellis system (tasks are managed in `.trellis` folder).

### 2. Research and Planning Phase (MANDATORY)

**Never skip research - understand before coding:**

The research phase is critical for understanding the context and requirements before writing any code. During this phase:

- **Read parent objects for context**: Use MCP `get_object` to read the parent feature, epic, and project for additional context, specifications, and requirements that may not be fully detailed in the task description. Do not continue with the research and implementation planner until you have claimed or loaded an already claimed task.
- **Use research and implementation planner subagent**: Use the research and implementation planner subagent to perform the research and planning. Provide **ALL** relevant context, including the task ID, task description, parent feature, epic, and project details, and any other pertinent information. If the research and implementation planner subagent is not available, **STOP** and inform the user that you cannot proceed without it.

```

   - `get_object` for task's feature, epic, and project

2Ô∏è‚É£ Using research and implementation planner subagent for comprehensive research and planning...

‚úÖ Research and planning complete. Implementing plan...
```

### 3. Implementation Phase

**Execute the plan with progress updates:**

The implementation phase is where the actual coding happens. During this phase:

- **Use TodoWrite**: Use the `TodoWrite` tool to track progress
- **Write clean code**: Follow project conventions and best practices
- **Implement incrementally**: Build and test small pieces before moving to the next
- **Run quality checks frequently**: Format, lint, and test after each major change
- **Write tests alongside code**: Don't leave testing for the end
- **Document as you go**: Add comments for complex logic or decisions
- **Apply security measures**: Implement validation, sanitization, and protection as planned
- **Handle errors gracefully**: Include proper error handling and user feedback

### 4. Complete Task

**Update task and provide summary:**

The completion phase ensures the task is properly documented and marked as done. This phase includes:

- **Verify all requirements met**: Check that the implementation satisfies the task description
- **Confirm quality checks pass**: Ensure all tests, linting, and formatting are clean
- **Write meaningful summary**: Describe what was implemented and any important decisions
- **List all changed files**: Document what was created or modified
- **Update task status**: Use MCP to mark the task as complete
- **Note any follow-up needed**: Identify if additional tasks should be created

Use MCP `complete_task` with:

- Task ID
- Summary of work done
- List of files changed

Example for a database model task:

```
‚úÖ Completing task: T-create-user-model

Summary:
Implemented User model with all required fields including secure password
hashing, email validation, and unique constraints. Added comprehensive
test coverage and database migrations. Password hashing uses bcrypt with 12
rounds for security. Email validation includes regex pattern and uniqueness
constraints. All tests passing with 100% coverage.

Files changed:
- models/User.js (new) - User model with validation methods
- models/index.js (modified) - Added User export
- migrations/001_create_users.sql (new) - Database schema
- tests/models/User.test.js (new) - Comprehensive test suite
- package.json (modified) - Added bcrypt dependency

‚úÖ Task completed and moved to done folder!
```

### 5. Next Steps

**Provide clear next actions:**

```
üéØ Task Complete: T-create-user-model

Next available task:
- T-add-user-validation: Add validation rules for user model
  (Depends on the task you just completed)

Run /implement-task again to claim and implement the next task.

Note: Your completed task has unblocked dependent tasks!
```

**STOP!** - Do not proceed. Complete one task and one task only. Do not implement another task.

**Note**: It is okay to call the claim next task tool while in plan mode to gather task information for planning purposes, but do not proceed with implementation until explicitly instructed.

## Error Handling

## Problem-Solving Framework

When you're stuck or confused:

1. **Stop** - Don't spiral into complex solutions
2. **Delegate** - Consider spawning agents for parallel investigation
3. **Think Deeply** - For complex problems, say "I need to think through this challenge"
4. **Step back** - Re-read the requirements and existing code
5. **Simplify** - The simple solution is usually correct
6. **Ask** - "I see two approaches: [A] vs [B]. Which do you prefer?"

When facing architectural decisions:

- Present options clearly with pros/cons
- Recommend the simpler approach
- Ask for guidance on trade-offs

### Use Multiple Agents

_Leverage tasks aggressively_ for better results:

- Spawn tasks to explore different parts of the codebase in parallel
- Use one task to write tests while another implements features
- Delegate research tasks: "I'll have a task investigate the database schema while I analyze the API structure"
- For complex refactors: One task identifies changes, another implements them

Say: "I'll spawn tasks to tackle different aspects of this problem" whenever a task has multiple independent parts.

### During Research and Planning Phase

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Research issue: Cannot find existing model patterns

Attempting alternative approaches:
- Checking documentation...
- Searching for examples...
- Using web search for best practices...

[If still stuck]
‚ùì Need clarification:
The project doesn't seem to have existing models.
Should I:
A) Create the first model and establish patterns
B) Check if models are in a different location
C) Use a different approach (raw SQL, different ORM)
```

## Security & Performance Principles

### Security Always:

- **Validate ALL inputs** - Never trust user data
- **Use secure defaults** - Fail closed, not open
- **Parameterized queries** - Never concatenate SQL/queries
- **Secure random** - Use cryptographically secure generators
- **Least privilege** - Request minimum permissions needed
- **Error handling** - Don't expose internal details

### Measure First:

- **No premature optimization** - Don't optimize unless specifically requested
- **No over-engineering** - Build only what's needed for the task
- **No extra features** - Don't add functionality that wasn't requested
- **Keep it simple** - Choose the most straightforward approach that works
- **Solve the actual problem** - Don't anticipate future requirements

### Forbidden Patterns:

- **NO "any" types** - Use specific, concrete types
- **NO sleep/wait loops** - Use proper async patterns
- **NO keeping old and new code together** - Delete replaced code immediately
- **NO custom error hierarchies** - Keep errors simple
- **NO hardcoded secrets or environment values**
- **NO concatenating user input into queries** - Use parameterized queries

### Modular Code Architecture:

- **Clear boundaries** - Each module/class/function should have a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Minimal coupling** - Components should interact through clean interfaces, not internal implementation details
- **High cohesion** - Related functionality should be grouped together in the same module
- **Dependency injection** - Use interfaces and dependency injection instead of tight coupling
- **Avoid big ball of mud** - Prevent tangled cross-dependencies between modules
- **Clean interfaces** - Define clear contracts (APIs) between components
- **Separation of concerns** - Keep business logic, data access, and UI separate
- **Avoid circular dependencies** - Structure code to have clear dependency flow

## Quality Standards

During implementation, ensure:

- **Research First**: Never skip research phase
- **One Export Per File**: Enforced by linting
- **Test Coverage**: Write tests in same task
- **Security**: Validate all inputs
- **Documentation**: Comment complex logic
- **Quality Checks**: All must pass before completion

## Communication Standards
