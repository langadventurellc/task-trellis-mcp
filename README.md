Task Trellis is an MCP server for project planning and task management built specifically for AI agents. It helps by breaking down complex projects and tracking their progress with built-in task management, complete with progress tracking, dependency management, and workflow automation. By default, all data is stored locally in Markdown files.

Primarily built as a much better alternative to managing markdown checklists. Task Trellis will make it easier to define requirements, specifications, and tasks in a structured way that the agents can actually use directly.

Full documentation is available in the [docs](docs/index.md) folder.

## Why Task Trellis?

### Without Task Trellis

- AI agents lose track of complex, multi-step projects
- Agents spin out of control with no clear task structure
- Tasks are often too large or vague, leading to confusion
- No way to manage dependencies or prerequisites
- No visibility into what's been completed vs. what's pending
- Tasks get forgotten, duplicated, or done out of order
- Zero coordination between multiple AI sessions
- Complex projects become chaotic and overwhelming

### With Task Trellis

- **Structured Breakdown**: Automatically organize projects into hierarchical tasks (depending on the size of the effort required)
  - Project → Epic → Feature → Task
  - See [Picking a Parent Issue Type](docs/issues.md#picking-a-parent-issue-type)
- **Smart Dependencies**: Prevent tasks from starting until prerequisites are complete
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time visibility into what's done, in-progress, and pending
- **Session Continuity**: Pick up exactly where you left off across AI conversations
- **Workflow Management**: Built-in task claiming, completion, and validation workflows
- **File Change Tracking**: Automatic documentation of what files were modified for each task
- **Learn from History**: AI agents can reference past work to inform future tasks

## Core Benefits

**Focused Execution**: AI agents work on one clearly-defined task at a time  
**Progress Visibility**: Always know project status and what's next  
**Dependency Management**: Automatic task ordering based on prerequisites  
**Audit Trail**: Complete history of all work completed and changes made  
**Multi-Session Support**: Seamlessly collaborate across different AI conversations  
**Productivity Boost**: Reduce context switching and eliminate forgotten tasks

## Usage

See full documentation at [Task Trellis MCP Documentation](docs/index.md)

### Basic Workflow

See sample prompts (written as Claude Code slash commands): [Sample Prompts](docs/sample_prompts/index.md)

1. **Create Tasks**
   - Determine your starting point based on the expected size of your project
     - **Project** - For sprawling initiatives with many moving parts
     - **Epic** - For large feature groupings
     - **Feature** - For specific functionality
     - **Task** - For individual work items

2. **Claim & Work on Tasks**
   - AI agent claims next available task
     - Excludes tasks that have incomplete prerequisites
     - Grabs the next highest priority available task
     - Mark a task as `draft` if you don't want it to be worked on yet - it won't be claimed when the tool looks for the next available task
   - Works on the specific task requirements
   - Marks task complete with file changes documented
     - Automatically tracks which files were modified
     - Logs summary of changes made
     - Work done in the future could reference this to better understand the current state of the project

3. **Track Progress**
   - View completed vs. pending work
   - See dependency relationships
   - Monitor overall project health

## Installation and Configuration

See [installation instructions](docs/installation.md).

## Available Tools

### Core Issue Management

- **create_issue** - Create projects, epics, features, or tasks with hierarchical relationships
- **update_issue** - Modify issue properties, status, priority, or prerequisites
- **get_issue** - Retrieve detailed issue information with history and relationships
- **list_issues** - Query and filter issues by type, status, priority, or scope (returns issue summaries)
- **delete_issue** - Remove issues (with dependency validation)
- **replace_issue_body_regex** - Make targeted body content edits using regex patterns

### Task Workflow Management

- **claim_task** - Claim available tasks for execution with automatic priority ordering
- **complete_task** - Mark tasks complete with file change documentation
- **append_issue_log** - Add progress notes and status updates to task history (occurs automatically on task completion)
- **append_modified_files** - Record files modified during task execution with change descriptions (occurs automatically on task completion)

### System Management

- **prune_closed** - Clean up old completed/cancelled issues for maintenance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Configuration issues:**

- Validate JSON syntax in MCP client configuration
- Ensure absolute paths are used for `--projectRootFolder`
- Restart your MCP client after configuration changes
